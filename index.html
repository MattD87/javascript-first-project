        <p>Imagine going to a baseball game around the beginning of the 20th century. Baseball has only been around for 30 or so years but has already become a popular game. You've bought a hotdog and beer and are waiting patiently as the players warm up and take batting practice.
            
        Suddenly, you hear a comotion behind you, a young man is coming through the stands and as he passes he grabs your beer and drinks it in front of you. He does this as he continues down the stands, taking beer and food from fans as he approaches the field. He hops over the wall, and starts taking off his clothes as he moves. Is this the birth of streaking? No, this is Rube Waddell and he's performing a common pregame ritual of entering through the grandstand, slamming beers, and getting changed into his uniform in front of the crowd. He's also the best player not only on the field, but in the entire league. </p>
                
        <p>George Edward "Rube" Waddell (1876 â€“ 1914) was an American pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB). His tumultous career spanned 13 years, playing for half a dozen different teams.

        <div id ="facts"><h3>Here's some interesting facts about Rube:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>He was the most dominant pitcher in the league during his career, which overlapped with the great Cy Young, who is the namesake of the best pitcher award given out each year by Major League Baseball</li>
                <li>He set almost every possible pitching record during his career, including strikeouts (a record that stood for 61 years) and was one of the firsts to sign a major new contract renegotiation</li>
                <li>He once fell asleep during a game. He was drunk, had given up a homerun, and decided to lay down on the mound.</li>
                <li>He was easily distracted, opposing fans would often bring puppies and shiny objects to games to distract him when he was on the mound. It worked far too often.</li>
                <li>If Rube heard a firetruck, he was gone. He chased every firetruck that passed the stadium during the game. He also had a tendency to leave the game midway through when he wanted to go fishing.</li>
                <li>Rube was recruited from the minor leagues to play in college. This is where he started some of his best known antics. He would often tell the rest of the his team to leave the field while he was pitching, leaving no one to defend if someone hit the ball past him.</li>
                <li>He was known to celebrate a 3 strikeout inning by cartwheeling, summersaulting, or else walking on his hands off the field.</li>
                <li>He quit the first professional team he played for after two days when he was fined for heavy drinking. He then disappeared and was not seen for months until he was spotted wrestling alligators with a travelling circus.</li>
                <li>Rube didn't understand the rules when he entered the minor leagues. He routinely threw the ball at batters instead of to the base to get them out, insisting that was the rule where he came from (it wasn't)</li>
                <li>He learned to pitch as a child by throwing rocks at birds. I wonder how he felt about playing for the Cardinals?</li>
                <li>His roommate negotiated his first major contract, but refused to finish until a clause was inserted that stated there could be no eating crackers in bed. They shared a bed on road trips.</li>
                <li>After baseball he started a career as an actor. He was incapable of remembering any of his lines and so improvised every one of them.</li>
